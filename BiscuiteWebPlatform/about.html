                  <p>Biscuite( the equivalent word in romanian for a... Cracker Cookie) is one of the creative games of my childhood.<br>Since it is an old game, 
                    it is originally played on a paper sheet. <br> The rules are the same as in 'Connect the Dots' but the difference is made by the board's shape<br> which is also the reason why it is called Biscuite.
                    <br> I took it as a challange to redefine the way how this game is played, <br>making use of my passion for Math and Computer Science. <br>Appart from being my first
                    summer project in this field, I enjoyed every second of it <br>because PLAYING is one of the things that characterize me as a person.<br>
                    This is also my first game in Unity. One of the challanges was to learn the paradigms and the best practices to use <br> the Unity Game Engine and C# Programming Language.<br>
                    It was also a good way of practicing what have been preaching to me at university classes:<br> 
                    Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Geometry, Fundamentals of Programming, Operating Systems and analytical thinking, skills that i find very helpful in developing a good product.
                    <br>Thank you for your time!
                    <br><br>Now, as my nephews would say: Let's Play Already!
                    <br><br>G. Ionut
